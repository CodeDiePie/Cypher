Hello and thank you for choosing to download this fun little python project called Cypher.
Cypher utilizes python,tkinter, and base64 to create a Vigen√®re cipher generator with a GUI,
messages can be encoded with a passkey and later be decoded with that same pass key. Take the code and
edit it to make it your own. Enjoy!
